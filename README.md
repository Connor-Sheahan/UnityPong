# Unity Pong
A version of Pong that I made in Unity, from scratch (with no tutorial), in C#.

This is a 2-player game; the left paddle is controlled using the 'W' and 'S' keys, and the right paddle is controlled using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.

The most notable part of this project is that I added a cute little paddle animation whenever a player scores. It was my first time working with Unity's animation system, so I'm thrilled to have it turn out so well.

NOTE: This repository is able to be downloaded in full as a zip file (no GitLFS issues)!
